## Elementary Programming / Ohjelmoinnin alkeet
### Minesweeper
This project is a Python implementation of the game Minesweeper. The game begins in a console menu where you can navigate using numerical inputs (an empty input will take you back).
The game features a graphical interface that has been implemented using the “haravasto” library, provided by the professor of this course.
After each game, you have the option to save your results to a JSON file. If a JSON file does not already exist, a new one will be created for storing game statistics.
