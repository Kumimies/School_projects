# School projects
Selection of courseworks done at the University of Oulu

## Elementary Programming / Ohjelmoinnin alkeet
### Minesweeper
This project is a Python implementation of the game Minesweeper. The game begins in a console menu where you can navigate using numerical inputs (an empty input will take you back).
The game features a graphical interface that has been implemented using the “haravasto” library, provided by the professor of this course.
After each game, you have the option to save your results to a JSON file. If a JSON file does not already exist, a new one will be created for storing game statistics.

## Programming 2
### Hangman
Java implementation of Hangman. List of possible words listed in words.txt file. The game gives you five guesses but this can be changed in code (row ten, switch integer 5 to something else).
The game runs on console.

## Computer systems
### C code snippets
Collection of C code snippets done throught the course.

    Factorial
    Average
    Floating point average
    Char counter
    TikTakToe

### Fibonacci in Y86-64
Fibonacci done in Y86-64 assembly. I recommend using this online simulator to test it out: https://boginw.github.io/js-y86-64/
Returns 0 to %rax register if all digits are fibonacci numbers, else it returns digit that is not fibonacci number (returns 666 but feel free to try with other values).
Sure this could've been implemented easier by just comparing it to list of confirmed fibonacci numbers but that was forbidden.
